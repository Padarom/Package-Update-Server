## Padaroms Update Server

This is a simple package update server for WoltLab Community Framework packages written in PHP 

## Installation
You can manually install this server by downloading the source code and running `composer install` to install all dependencies.

For releases I also provide a pre-packaged version that already contains all dependencies (about 10MB in size), that you can just drop in and run without any further configuration.
